Description: Software creation is a pretty big deal!  A repository's initial commit date can be thought of as its birthday.  Next time, drop in and wish a developer (any Github username) a happy birthday of their repo(s).  Or maybe just toast to the upcoming anniversary of your own software!  The software life cycle is too short not to celebrate!
